Hosting Review Modules for Live Composer
====================
This plugin adds in our optinion, very useful modules for Live Composer, which exploits functionality of probably most useful plugins.

## Description
This is an additional plug-in for the Live Composer tool. It helps you to edit difficult, often code-heavy Advanced Custom Fields information, in a simple, intuitive drag-and-drop way.

Instead of getting into the code or editing with multiple clicks, you can add a module and edit its size/text/fonts/styles and many other things with no problems.

Using this plug-in requires Live Composer and Advanced Custom Fields to be installed. This is a gateway, bringing the powerful functionality of Advanced Custom Fields and the intuitiveness of Live Composer.
